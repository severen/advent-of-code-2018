# Programming Practice

This repository contains various programming exercises and puzzles from various
places that I've attempted to solve.

## Why?

I started doing these for a simple reason: I realised that I wasn't as good at
the fundamentals of programming as I would like to be.

Therefore this repository is one attempt to fix that.

Additionally, solving problems is a good skill to exercise in general, not to
mention being a (generally) enjoyable and fun thing to spend time on (especially
when you hit one of those aha moments).
