# Advent of Code 2018

These are my solutions for the [Advent of Code
2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018).

The language I have chosen to implement my solutions in this year is
[Rust](https://rust-lang.org/), with an additional attempt to write the
solutions in [Haskell](https://haskell.org/) as well.

To run a Rust solution, enter its directory and invoke the program with Cargo.
For example:

```sh
$ cd rust/day01
$ cargo run
```

To run a Haskell solution, enter its directory and invoke the program with
`runhaskell`. For example:

```sh
$ cd haskell
$ runhaskell day01.hs
```
