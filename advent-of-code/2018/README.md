# Advent of Code 2018

These are my solutions for the [Advent of Code
2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018).

The language I have chosen to implement my solutions in this year is
[Rust](https://rust-lang.org/).

To run a solution, enter its directory and invoke the program with Cargo. For
example:

```sh
$ cd day01
$ cargo run
```
