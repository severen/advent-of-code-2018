# Advent of Code 2019

These are my solutions for the [Advent of Code
2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019).

The language I have chosen to implement my solutions in this year is
[Rust](https://rust-lang.org/).

To run a Rust solution, enter its directory and invoke the program with Cargo.
For example:

```sh
$ cd rust/day01
$ cargo run
```
